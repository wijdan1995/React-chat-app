# React Chat App

## Description 
This app is to practice React.js and CSS grid following this free course https://scrimba.com/g/greactchatkit

---

## Changes by me
* The course is from a year ago and the ChatKit Docs changed, so I had to read it to alter the changes to keep up with the course.
* In the course, the instructor used React state with the constructor, And I didn't use it so I don't have to bind all the functions
